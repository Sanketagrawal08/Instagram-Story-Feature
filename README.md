# Instagram-Story-Feature

ðŸŽ‰ Excited to share a small yet significant milestone in my JavaScript journey! Today, I built an Instagram Story feature using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. ðŸ“¸

This project helped me dive into new concepts Iâ€™ve been eager to learn, and gave me the chance to apply new ideas in a real-world setting.

Every small step brings me closer to mastering the language and turning my knowledge into impactful solutions. Looking forward to whatâ€™s next! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¯ #JavaScript #WebDevelopment #LearningByDoing #HTML #CSS #TechJourney #Innovation
